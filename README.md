This package contains a base Testcase Class that can be used to run end-to-end tests against Selenium 2 (using its Selenium 1 backward compatible Api).

**Please direct pull requests to [giorgiosironi/phpunit-selenium](https://github.com/giorgiosironi/phpunit-selenium) for automated testing upon merging**.

A feature branch containing all the commits you want to propose works best.

Running the test suite
---

#### Via Vagrant

Just run the following Vagrant commands (a minimal version of `v1.7` is required) and everything will be set up for you. The first start will take some time which depends on the speed of your connection (and less - speed of your computer):

    vagrant up
    vagrant provision
    vagrant ssh

    cd /vagrant
    vendor/bin/phpunit Tests
 
and you must see the `phpunit` testing `phpunit-selenium` project.
